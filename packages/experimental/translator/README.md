## Summary

`ctx.translator` translates one bounded text request through Google or Bing. It requires no API key or login and defaults to Google. This experimental package is opt-in.

## Use this package

Mount the package as a Cordis service. Call `resolve({ text, targetLanguage, sourceLanguage?, provider? })`, then `translate(spec, signal?)`. The result is plain translated text. An omitted source uses `auto`; an omitted provider uses configured `provider`, initially `google`. Consumers can read `maxTextChars` to split longer text before submission.

| Config | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `provider` | `google` | `google` or `bing` |
| `googleEndpoint` | `https://translate.googleapis.com/translate_a/single` | Google-compatible anonymous endpoint |
| `bingEndpoint` | `https://edge.microsoft.com/translate/translatetext` | Microsoft Edge browser translation endpoint |
| `timeoutMs` | `10000` | Deadline for the request and complete response body |
| `maxTextChars` | `4000` | Maximum submitted UTF-16 code units per request |
| `maxResponseBytes` | `1048576` | Maximum response body bytes before JSON parsing |

Endpoints accept HTTP(S) URLs without credentials or fragments. Native `fetch` uses the Host's global dispatcher and the HTTP proxy policy installed by the `dsh` launcher. No new translation library is required.

The service maps `zh`, `zh-CN`, `zh-SG` and `zh-Hans` to Simplified Chinese, and `zh-TW`, `zh-HK`, `zh-MO` and `zh-Hant` to Traditional Chinese. Other tags pass through to the selected provider. Empty text returns an empty string without a network request.

## Understand the implementation

<details>
<summary>Maintainer details — click to expand</summary>

Google receives a GET request using the `gtx` client; Bing receives a JSON text array through Microsoft's Edge endpoint. The selected service receives the submitted text. Cookies, HTTP redirects and automatic provider fallback are disabled. Text and translations remain transient; this service changes neither Session events nor model requests.

`TranslationError.code` distinguishes input limits, HTTP failures, response limits, invalid provider responses and transport failures. Diagnostics include no submitted text or provider error body. Caller cancellation and timeouts retain their original abort reasons. Unloading aborts accepted requests and waits for settlement. Input limits apply in both `resolve()` and `translate()`.

<a id="model-experience"></a>
## Model Experience

None, as translation is transient and does not contribute to model requests or Session logs.

#### KV Cache effect

No direct effect; translation does not change model history.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

<a id="known-limitations-and-deferred-work"></a>

- These unofficial browser endpoints have no supported third-party API guarantee. They may rate-limit requests, become unavailable or change response formats. Availability from mainland China depends on the user's network; the service guarantees no region-wide connectivity.
- Unsupported language tags fail through the selected provider. Consumers own paragraph scheduling, input splitting, caching and any display fallback; this service performs one request and never retries or switches providers.
