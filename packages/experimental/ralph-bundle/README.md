## Use this package

In Web or Desktop, open Plugins and enable **Ralph loops** in Official. Switch it off to remove its profile layer.

New Agents and subsequently reopened Sessions use the selected composition; live Agents retain their existing plugins. The minimal preset and host-level tool catalog remain unchanged.

## Understand the implementation

<details>
<summary>Implementation details — click to expand</summary>

[`cordis.patch.yml`](cordis.patch.yml) contributes rows through `preset: preset-standard`, `preset: preset-cordis`, and `preset: preset-ptc`. Later profile patches can override their settings. The [profile composer](../../boot/app-boot/README.md) owns patch ordering and errors.

## Further Exploration

[Capability implementation](../tool-ralph/README.md)

<a id="model-experience"></a>
## Model Experience

Indirectly, through the [capability implementation](../tool-ralph/README.md), which owns model context and results.

#### KV Cache effect

The layer adds no request content directly; the capability implementation owns cache effects from tools, prompts, and results.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

<a id="known-limitations-and-deferred-work"></a>

- Ralph requires explicit human intent to run a loop and can consume substantial model tokens across rounds. Its workflow engine is isolated from other workflow tools.
