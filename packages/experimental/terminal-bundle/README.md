## Summary

Add six experimental terminal tools to standard, cordis, and ptc. Each Agent receives an isolated terminal registry with the platform shell backend. It ships switched off in Web and Desktop. Select it in Plugins to enable it.

## Use this package

In Web or Desktop, open Plugins and enable **Persistent terminals** in Official. Switch it off to remove its profile layer.

New Agents and subsequently reopened Sessions use the selected composition; live Agents retain their existing plugins. The minimal preset and host-level tool catalog remain unchanged.

## Understand the implementation

<details>
<summary>Implementation details — click to expand</summary>

[`cordis.patch.yml`](cordis.patch.yml) contributes rows through `preset: preset-standard`, `preset: preset-cordis`, and `preset: preset-ptc`. Later profile patches can override their settings. The [profile composer](../../boot/app-boot/README.md) owns patch ordering and errors.

## Further Exploration

[Capability implementation](../tool-terminal/README.md)

<a id="model-experience"></a>
## Model Experience

Indirectly, through the [capability implementation](../tool-terminal/README.md), which owns model context and results.

#### KV Cache effect

The layer adds no request content directly; the capability implementation owns cache effects from tools, prompts, and results.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

<a id="known-limitations-and-deferred-work"></a>

- Terminals belong to the Agent that created them. POSIX uses Bash and Windows uses PowerShell; the bundle does not share the minimal preset's terminal registry.
