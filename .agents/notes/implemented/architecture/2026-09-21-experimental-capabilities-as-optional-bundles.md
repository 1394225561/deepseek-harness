# Agent Note: Ship experimental capabilities as optional bundles

Status: implemented

English | [中文](2026-09-21-experimental-capabilities-as-optional-bundles.zh.md)

## Problem

The Web plugin page offered two optional bundles, Agent Teams and voice input. Auto review and the Inspector were published experimental packages that a person had to install by name or mount through a hand-written profile patch, although both already declared a bundle patch or shipped a mountable overlay.

## Decision

`OPTIONAL_BUNDLES` owns the installation's default-off selections, including maintained optional capabilities and experimental capabilities. Every bundle declares `icon` and exports `./locale/*.json` with `meta.title` and `meta.description`; the Official group displays that metadata. A bundle's presentation does not determine its [experimental status](../../../../packages/experimental/README.md#status). The isolation check validates admission and still rejects experimental dependencies of nonexperimental bundles.

An optional bundle's dependencies are downloaded with every `dsh` installation. [Reasoning translation](2026-10-05-anonymous-reasoning-translation.md) uses three experimental packages without adding third-party runtime dependencies. Admission therefore considers installation cost and whether a switch supplies a usable composition without an additional configuration form. Browser and computer providers remain explicit compositions because they add substantial runtimes or require an external executable. Stagehand requires model credentials; Python PTC replaces a core provider and conflicts with TypeScript workflow consumers. Demonstrative hooks, webhooks, and mods stay outside the list. [Session Inspector](../feature/2026-09-24-session-inspector.md) owns the Inspector's distinct activation behavior.

Bundles add scoped rows with the [profile patch operation](../../../../packages/boot/app-boot/README.md): `preset` names a declaration row, and the ordinary patch operates on its child list. Full Web presets receive the optional model tools; minimal retains its exact platform shell catalog. Search, Ralph, and terminals supply their own isolated services. Search opens one in-memory index on demand per retained preset revision; the Host search policy stays unchanged. Badge skills and title providers act on the Host. Existing Agents retain their preset generation, and later user patch layers retain precedence. Title replacement waits for disposal of the previous provider.

## Alternatives considered

**Ship every provider as an optional bundle.** Composes and displays correctly, but grows every install by provider runtimes for a capability most installations never switch on; voice input's `sherpa-onnx-node` is the one accepted precedent.

**Mount the registration-only `computer-use` and `browser-use` services in `dsh-base`.** The shared composition would carry rows that only an optional provider bundle needs; a provider bundle can insert the service row from its own patch and dependencies.

**Register preset extensions at runtime.** A separate registration path would need its own ordering, module resolution, generation updates, and inspection behavior. Profile patches keep one effective composition for boot, dumps, validation, and user overrides.

## Consequences

Official discovery does not imply experimental status or a different plugin lifecycle. Switching a bundle off keeps its installed files; failed activation retains the existing saved-selection behavior. Scoped rows appear read-only under their bundle, and removal respects modules retained by live preset generations. Individual and combined composition tests cover the supported presets; live switching and recorded Sessions cover activation and model-visible behavior.
