# Text translation

English | [中文](translation.zh.md)

The experimental [translator](../../packages/experimental/translator/README.md) translates text through anonymous Google or Bing browser endpoints. Consumers own display, scheduling, and Session activation; Session-bound requests retain reusable results through an active Session writer.

## Requests and results

`TranslationProvider` selects `google` or `bing`. `TranslationRequest` supplies `text`, `targetLanguage`, and optional `sourceLanguage`, `provider` and branded `sessionId`. `resolve()` captures explicit routing in `TranslationSpec`: the configured provider defaults to Bing and omitted source language uses automatic detection. Common Chinese locale tags map to the selected provider's language codes. `translate()` returns plain text from the resolved provider.

The service exposes its configured `maxTextChars`, measured in UTF-16 code units. Consumers split longer inputs before requesting translation. Each call bounds the response bytes and includes the response-body read in its deadline. Caller cancellation and service disposal abort accepted requests; disposal waits for them to settle.

## Failures and data handling

`TranslationError` carries a `TranslationErrorCode` distinguishing text limits, HTTP failures, invalid responses, response limits, owned deadlines, and request failures. `TRANSLATION_SESSION_REQUIRED` rejects a missing persistence backend or Session; `TRANSLATION_SESSION_INACTIVE` rejects an uncached inactive Session before provider dispatch; `TRANSLATION_STORAGE_ERROR` rejects invalid saved records or failed durability. Provider diagnostics omit submitted text and response bodies. Failed calls do not select another provider. Responses are validated as external JSON and redirects are rejected.

Google receives source text in a form POST body; Bing receives it in a JSON POST body. Both are remote services. Their anonymous endpoints provide no supported developer availability or quota guarantee. Regional connectivity must be verified on the user's network.

## Persistent translations

Session-bound calls use `plugin:translator/request` and `plugin:translator/result` for every provider. Requests retain exact source, language tags, selected provider and recipe identity; a successful result references its request sequence. Optional request metadata holds provider-specific details without changing these record types. The translator checkpoints requests before external dispatch and completed results before returning them. Read-only cache lookup precedes provider work and needs no live Session; failures and incomplete attempts do not supply reusable text. New records use the active Session's existing writer. The translator opens no write handle and does not activate a Session. Translation records preserve the original events and model input. Calls without a Session stay stateless. Experimental record retention across future format migrations is best-effort.

## Reasoning display

The [optional bundle](../../packages/experimental/cot-translation-bundle/README.md) composes the translator with the [GUI consumer](../../packages/experimental/client-ui-cot-translation/README.md). Its `cotTranslation` Remote serves authenticated browser calls. When a Session is inactive and has no saved result, the Host joins normal Session controller activation and retries once. Activation retains normal preset hooks, resume markers, and interrupted-turn repair; cancellation stops the caller's wait and prevents a later translation call without cancelling shared activation. Bundle settings select a translation service and target language; `auto` follows the active interface language.

`CotTranslationPreferences` contains the accepted provider and target language. `CotTranslationSnapshot` pairs these preferences with the translator's current `maxTextChars`. The browser reads this Host snapshot before registering translation controls, including when local settings storage is unavailable. Accepted settings updates and reconnects refresh both values; a changed request limit cancels and splits the expanded text again.

The session-scoped `conversation.chat.reasoning-body` chain receives the original `text` and `running` flag. Chat renders original Markdown when no contribution claims it. While enabled, the GUI translates completed paragraphs and request-sized prefixes of long streaming paragraphs only after expansion, and restores completed results from the current Session. Its local cache only optimizes that disclosure. The unfinished tail remains original. Original remains accessible. Closing the disclosure, switching provider or language, and unloading cancel outstanding calls and exclude late results. Provider failure preserves the original and requires an explicit retry; translated text never replaces original Session events or model input.

## Cordis API

Generated from source by `scripts/gen-cordis-catalog.ts` (verified fresh by `pnpm run verify-cordis-catalog` in doc-sync; regenerate with `pnpm run gen-cordis-catalog`) — the language sides differ only in locale-specific paired document paths. Signature blocks use a `ts cordis-catalog` fence and keep the original source JSDoc; dispatch modes are defined in the [primer](../cordis-primer.md#dispatch-modes), and the framework-inherited `ctx` API lives in [cordis-api/inherited.md](../cordis-api/inherited.md).

### `ctx.cotTranslation` — `CotTranslationController`

Optional reasoning translation delegates Session-bound storage to the translator.

```ts cordis-catalog
/**
 * Read accepted translation preferences and the current request limit without sending text.
 * @param signal - browser query cancellation or Remote contribution withdrawal.
 * @returns authoritative preferences and maximum UTF-16 text length per request.
 */
@Remote limits(signal: AbortSignal): CotTranslationSnapshot

/**
 * Translate one displayed fragment through the reader's selected provider.
 * @param request - original text and Session identity supplied by the Client; provider and explicit
 * target language match accepted preferences, while auto uses the browser locale.
 * @param signal - browser cancellation or Remote contribution withdrawal.
 * @returns translated text; an uncached inactive Session joins ordinary GUI activation before retry.
 * Failures omit the source and provider response. Cancellation stops this caller's wait, not shared activation.
 */
@Remote async translate(request: TranslationRequest, signal: AbortSignal): Promise<string>
```

### `ctx.translator` — `Translator`

One Host service with explicit routing, cancellation and quiescent unload.

```ts cordis-catalog
/**
 * Resolve provider and source-language defaults without sending text.
 * @param request - consumer text, destination and optional routing choices.
 * @returns a complete specification; exceeding `maxTextChars` throws `TRANSLATION_TEXT_LIMIT`.
 */
resolve(request: TranslationRequest): TranslationSpec

/**
 * Translate one resolved specification; the selected provider receives its text.
 * @param spec - complete routing and language choices from `resolve()`.
 * @param signal - optional caller cancellation, combined with service disposal.
 * @returns translated plain text, durably retained before return when a Session is supplied.
 * An uncached supplied Session must be active; otherwise rejects with `TRANSLATION_SESSION_INACTIVE` before dispatch.
 * Rejects provider/storage/limit failures and preserves cancellation reasons.
 */
async translate(spec: TranslationSpec, signal?: AbortSignal): Promise<string>
```
